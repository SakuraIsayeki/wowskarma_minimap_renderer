## Minimap Renderer

![Tests](https://github.com/WoWs-Builder-Team/minimap_renderer/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

Minimap Renderer parses World of Warships replays to create a timelapse video that resembles the in-game minimap.

### Installation

1. Install Python 3.11
2. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.
	- Linux
		```
		python3.11 -m venv venv && . venv/bin/activate
		```
	- Windows
		```
		py -3.11 -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate.bat
		```
	- You should now see `(venv)` at the start of the command prompt.
3. Install the renderer package. To install the renderer package use this command.
	```
	pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/WoWs-Builder-Team/minimap_renderer.git
	```
4. You're all set.

### Usage
Replays can be rendered with `render` module. The full usage is:
```
python -m render --replay <replay_path>
```
This will create a `.mp4` file from your replay file.

Since the renderer is installed to a virtual environment, you need to activate it once before you render. Once activated, you can render any replay file as long as it is a valid replay file.
